Add conditionals to the scripts being loaded so they only load on specified pages and speed up your load times.

== Description ==

Script Logic aims to accomplish with enqueued scripts what Widget Logic does for widgets: apply some basic php conditionals to restrict or enqueue scripts on specific pages, but not others without modifying your theme's code.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.
